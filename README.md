Background
A local environmental group is researching various airport companies and is better trying to understand both financial and environmental aspects of the target companies. The group has asked us, budding data analysts, to collect some intel on their targets of interest. They have an interest in finding out how many flights the airport serves, financials about the company, environmental data about the airport and relative performance in terms of ESG scoring in comparison to competitors, among others.

We have formulated some of the questions (seen later in this document) that we believe the environmentalist want answering. These questions account for a basis to identify, collect, process, and then store the data.
Moreover, with a recent news-report on how the number of flights is rebounding after people start flying again after not being able to do due to COVID, they have a particular interest in how the number of flights has changed before and during the pandemic. They also want to know how the share price has changed during this period.

The environmentalists are having difficulty in finding the data in a readily consumable format and do not have any funding to buy the data. They have asked us to collect the data from a range of public sources, collecting it from (semi)-unstructured sources where necessary and then load it into a database. They suggest that we begin in a wide search of stock exchange listed airport companies and then refine the search down to two, do a deeper dive on environmental aspects and then they should be able to do further analysis and advanced visualisation themselves.
